Split-core current transformers provide accurate measurements of AC electrical systems and feature a removeable or hinged leg for easy installation without disconnecting wires or interrupting power. Both retrofit and semi-permanent metering applications can benefit from the split-coreâ€™s non-invasive design (Accuenergy, 2015). It offers many benefits, such as easy installation and non-intrusive current measurement. It also has risks to consider, such as calibration errors and temperature sensitivity. 
This project will monitor calibration status, temperature and current output using IoT Integration for remote monitoring and management
