#Wireless transfer of elecrical energy through piezoelectric


Piezoelectric Effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress while the converse piezoelectric effect is the vice versa of it.This project is about the use of piezoelectric as a mean of wireless transfer of electrical energy. Applying a voltage supply to a  piezoelectric crystal, it starts to vibrate and these vibrations generate sound waves with frequencies between 1.5 and 8 MHz (i.e ultrasound). Thus, piezoelectric crystals can convert electric currents into ultrasound waves.
